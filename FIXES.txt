- clone() call when using curl?
- remove fprints from etcd-api
- FIXED: when library is used as .so, it's adding a space into the name
- remove curl_global_init() in etcd-api 
- deal with the function being called with IPv6 (./showip database.primary)
- curl global init?
- thread safety?
- recursive lookups (if curl is using a hostname)
- ordering in nssswitch.conf (before or after DNS)
- external config file
- proper NSS_STATUS_ return codes
- stress test to check for memory leaks
- valgrind over it

obvious
- error handling
- make sure we are free()ing things that need to be freed

building:
gcc -shared -fPIC -o0 -g  nss-etcd.c etcd-api.c -o libnss_etcd.so.2 -lcurl -lyajl
sudo cp libnss_etcd.so.2 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_etcd.so.2
